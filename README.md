# game-mixer

WIP

This is based upon `libsoundio-d`: https://code.dlang.org/packages/libsoundio-d
The idea is to have a pure D `nothrow @nogc` library that can playback music and samples, and global FX.
So, a bit like SDL2_mixer but without a dependency. It would be usable in an audio plug-in for example, or a game.
